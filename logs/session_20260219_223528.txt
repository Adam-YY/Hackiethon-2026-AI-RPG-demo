Scene Description: A century ago, the last elemental Dragon was slain, and the world’s mana pools dried up. Humanity replaced spells with steam and gears. In the city of Orizon, magic is no longer a wonder—it’s a pollutant.

The Maintenance Hub, Sector 4. You sit at your workbench. The room is heavy with the smell of ozone and burnt oil. Your mana meter flickers—a steady, low hum of background pollution. Your supervisor, a man who smells of cheap tobacco and machine oil, slams a grease-stained work order onto your desk.
