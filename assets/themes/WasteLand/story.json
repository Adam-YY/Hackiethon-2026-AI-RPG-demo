  "scripts": {
    "script_1": "A century ago, the last elemental Dragon was slain, and the world’s mana pools dried up. Humanity replaced spells with steam and gears. In the city of Orizon, magic is no longer a wonder\u2014it\u2019s a pollutant. You are a 'Disenchanter'\u2014an important role that blends the tasks of an exorcist and a mechanic, cleaning \u201cthe echoes\" (magical residues) from the city and resolves mechanical defects.\n\nThe Maintenance Hub, Sector 4. You sit at your workbench. The room is heavy with the smell of ozone and burnt oil. Your mana meter flickers\u2014a steady, low hum of background pollution. Your supervisor, a man who smells of cheap tobacco and machine oil, slams a grease-stained work order onto your desk.\n\n\"Northside\u2019s screaming,\" he grunts, \"Pressure is bottoming out in the main pipes. The locals say the pipes are murmuring. Probably just some dead sprite caught in the intake. Go down there, fix the pipes, and clear the echoes. And keep your ears plugged\u2014those sounds will rot your brain.\"",
    "script_2": "You gather your gear. The alchemy rifle feels heavy on your shoulder, and the sorcerer's ring cold on your finger. You look at the work order. Northside is a maze of high-pressure steam and low-life shadows. Your supervisor asks if you want to allocate more people to your team.",
    "script_3": "You push the work order back across the desk. \"Find someone else. I\u2019ve had enough of the 'screaming' for one week.\"\n\nThe supervisor grunts, chewing on his cigar. \"Suit yourself. If you\u2019d rather grease the primary pistons in Sector 1 than hunt ghosts, that\u2019s your job now.\"\n\nMonths later, as you huddle in a doorway, you hear a rumor that Sector 4 vanished overnight\u2014swallowed by a silver fire that the city's steam-works couldn't quench. You wonder, briefly, if you could have stopped it.",
    "script_4": "You arrive at the main junction with two other Disenchanters. The reinforced iron pipes are buckled and cracked, hissing clouds of industrial gas. Your colleagues cover their ears, cursing the \"head-splitting screech\" of the leaking steam.\n\nBut to you, the sound isn't a screech. It\u2019s a polyphonic call, pulsing in time with your heart. \u201cCome closer,\u201d a voice whispers through the steam. \u201cThe iron is a cage. Set me free.\u201d You see faint, silver runes glowing on the floor, leading deeper into the dark.",
    "script_5": "You stand alone before the cracked pipes. The gas creates a hazy, silver fog. The vibration in your boots is intoxicating. The runes on the floor point toward a hidden gap in the masonry\u2014a path into the deeper sewerage that isn't on any map.",
    "script_6": "You lead your colleagues down into the forgotten cavern. Together, you find the Dragon Egg. Its pearlescent heat illuminates the cavern, reflecting off their brass goggles.\n\n\"Do you know how much power is in this thing?\" one colleague whispers, his eyes wide with greed. You and your colleagues report the find to the City Council. Within the week, the egg is encased in lead and hooked to the city's main turbine. Its magic is harvested to fuel Orizon for another decade. You receive a promotion and a medal, but every night, you hear the muffled screaming of the egg through the city's pipes.",
    "script_7": "You decide to shut your mouth and keep the mysterious words to yourself. What will you do with the odd pleading you heard?",
    "script_8": "You tighten the bolts, weld the cracks, and vent the gas. The \"screaming\" stops, replaced by the dull, mindless thud of steam. You go home, collect your pay, and sleep a dreamless sleep. The magic in your ring grows dimmer every day, until finally, it is nothing more than a piece of scrap metal. The world remains gray, loud, and dying.",
    "script_9_1": "The melody in the pipes is a physical pull, tugging at the very marrow of your bones. You slip through a jagged crack in the reinforced iron.\n\nAs you descend, the air grows thick with a shimmering, silver mist\u2014magical residue. You hold the ring into the thickest clouds of residue and watches the silver mist spiral into the ring\u2019s central gem. A rush of heat travels up your arm and into your chest, clearing the soot from your lungs (+20 Mana).\n\nWith your senses sharpened and your ring humming with power, you face the split in the road.",
    "script_9_2": "You return under the cover of darkness while Orizon\u2019s engines sleep. As you follow the runes, stepping deeper into the sewer, the air grows thick with a shimmering, silver mist\u2014magical residue. You hold the ring into the thickest clouds of residue and watches the silver mist spiral into the ring\u2019s central gem. A rush of heat travels up your arm and into your chest, clearing the soot from your lungs (+20 Mana). The air is thick with the scent of ozone and ancient rain. You reach a junction where the sewer splits into three distinct tunnels.",
    "script_11": "As you step forward, the shadows begin to knit together. \"Echoes\"\u2014the magic-animated corpses of workers who died in the pipes\u2014stagger toward you. Their eyes glow with a sickly violet light, and their movements are jerky, like broken puppets.",
    "script_10": "The \"Echoes\" emerge from the gloom\u2014shambling corpses of former sewer workers, their skin translucent and glowing with a sickly violet rot. They don't scream; they hum a discordant, terrifying note.\n\nYou level your Alchemy Rifle and squeeze the trigger, blowing a hole through the lead corpse. As the others swarm around you, you unleash a Fireball followed by a jagged bolt of Lightning.\n\nBefore they dissolve, one of the corpse lunges with a freezing touch, and their discordant humming vibrates painfully in your skull. They eventually vanish into shimmering mist, leaving you breathless in the ozone-heavy air.",
    "script_12": "You step through a curtain of vines and leave Orizon behind. You\u2019ve found a hidden oasis deep in the earth. Glowing ferns light up the cave, and flowers of light grow over rusted gears. The air here is fresh and sweet, free of the city\u2019s smoke.\n\nIn the center sits the Dragon Egg. It rests on a bed of soft moss, pulsing like a living sun, singing a beautiful, majestic song.\n\nAs you approach, your Disenchanter\u2019s tools begin to glow. \u201cThe machines are starving the world,\" The egg speaks directly into your mind. \"They grind the soul of the earth into smoke. Be my Guardian. Carry me from this tomb, and I will grant you the Fire that once moved the stars. Together, we will dismantle their engines and bring the Dawn of the New Magic.\u201d",
    "script_13": "You turn your back on the magic, the monsters, and the mystery. You climb out of the manhole, seal the lid, and walk into the rain. You leave your tools in an alleyway and hop the first rail-car out of Orizon. Some secrets are better left buried in the dark.",
    "script_accept_offer": "You become the Guardian of the Dragon Egg. Together, you will dismantle the engines of Orizon and bring the Dawn of the New Magic. Your journey out of the city begins, carrying the seed of a new world.",
    "script_reject_offer": "You decide that this creature is a threat to Orizon. You level your alchemy rifle and prepare for the battle of your life. The dragon egg pulses with a defensive fury. The battle for Orizon begins here, in the silence of the hidden oasis."
